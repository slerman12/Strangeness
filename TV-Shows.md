The stock market is no different than if TV show writers sold stocks whose fraction allowed owners to weigh in on writing decisions. 

And that’s all. That’s the full analogy. Maybe those writers can offer some dividends from their profits. 

The rest is just the public speculating about that show’s ratings and the perceived value of the stocks that allow people to weigh in or possibly earn some small fraction of dividend profits from. 

There is no additional factor, so it’s a bit confusing, to think we have an entire economy based on this premise. 

Moreover, it makes me want to make a generalized version of Robinhood, that allows anybody to take *anything* "public," pricing their stocks however they see fit, advertising them, and that’s all. 

For example, I can sell a stock that weighs in on what I wear to interviews (though I’m writing this January 6, 2025). I could price it pretty low at this time. 

Would it be unethical? To build yet another virtual casino? Is our whole economy unethical? Does one person’s gain always mean another person’s loss? Well, as long as buyers and sellers keep circulating, no, but sustaining that circulation process is algorithmically complicated, requires inflation, illusions, and actual productivity* increases in the world. 

*celebration/health/love/happiness/real-richness

Of course, for those to perpetually rise, death must exist, thereby forgetting the earlier gains and starting over for another experience. Death, or tragedy. The universe would love accelerative rise into the Garden of Eden, but once attained, that circulation stops, and certain economics necessarily become unethical for that lack of circulation resulting in one person’s gain being at the cost of another person’s loss. 

The universe’s economics are qualia though—celebration and health—not money. 

In those, there is a possibility for sustained peace, without accelerative rise. A good symbiosis in nature, too. An economy that distributes. But the basis of TV show ratings is competition and profit, both of which can be exploited through the kinds of virtual casinos I described, and sometimes reinforced, though not necessarily causing, and maybe another system exists in which people would watch and create TV shows out of the love of storytelling and from their own individual spirit, wherein ratings are just a good byproduct and competition isn’t life-staking for those shows to keep existing, or benefiting the creator even lacking a single viewer. 

Is it possible for a 5-star show to have a very low rating?
