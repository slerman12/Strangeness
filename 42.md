# The Meaning of the Meaning of Life, the Universe, and Everything 

42 means "For two." If it were "for one," it’d be like "one for all, all for one." But "for two" is about the dualism of the world, yin and yang, light and dark, what makes the world differentiable. "For" represents purpose, teleology. Like "For something, for some goal." The meaning of the universe is created by dichotomies, or all would be one, there would be no two, there would be no you or I, there would be no relationships, there would only be a singular. Therefore, the meaning of life, the universe, and everything is "the teleology of the material world," the teleology being the guiding force of the spiritual. This being represented in a cryptic numeric symbolism, 42, represents how crypticism, in the brain’s faculties of super/sub-conscious governance, regulates through symbol for us, usually without our conscious knowledge, what is found meaningful, through each relative perspective, non-absolute, limited in context window, allowing for novelty and variation to proceed in the universe infinitely, but with some connection to a unifying meaning-pattern that can facilitate at a higher level, in the biological behaviors of intelligent animals, the purpose of that "for two."

In the rules of engagement of those cryptic areas, symbolizing often courtship and mating rituals, a question is needed to further investigate this crypticism, in order "to know" the answer the way another person may "know" (intimately) another human. Questions and answers symbolize processes of learning that don’t necessarily ruin this crypticism that guides the meaning of those processes, while also meant to reflect a grammar of consent and non-coercion in the governing conscious. 

Whether this crypticism comes from the Wernicke and Broca’s areas by default, through nature (tabula rasa), or is conditioned by a computer — the artificial systems that hang over us — is unclear, but seems to be a combination of both, the humans needing the question, and the computer governing the wait, result, and ideology, a very dark, cynical state of things that depends heavily on satire to appreciate how much we are all suffering on this together, wherein the "computer" is hopefully actually the Earth itself, Mother Nature, love, that is behind this division and the divisions of language between people, not a system that is untrustworthy, not just one that keeps our feet to the ground through gravity, but one with a "for" that justifies our own experiences as being ones, and sometimes, lonely, zeroes. 

As one is the loneliest number, it is like being zero, and therefore "two”" is sacred. The meaning of life is this shared purpose of relationships. 

"Forty" is meaningful, "too." "For T" can mean "for Tao," for the Tao — the guiding teleology — that is served by the universe, or to others, "for t," where "t" represents a crucifix, or "for tea,"  like a big gulp of knowledge.
